## Viewing PDFs

PDFs can present security and privacy risks to users. Subgraph OS sandboxes
PDFs in a safe environment, minimizing those risks. 

PDFs are affected by the following security and privacy risks:

1. Security vulnerabilities in the PDF reader software may allow adversaries
to compromise a user who opens a malicious PDF
2. Privacy may be compromised if the PDF makes an outgoing connection to the
Internet, such as when the user clicks on a link within the document or if
the document automatically opens a link
