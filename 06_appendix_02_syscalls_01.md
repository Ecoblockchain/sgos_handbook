## System call table

This section includes the Linux system call table for 64-bit Intel computers. 
You can use the table to look up the corresponding numbers for system calls. 
This will help when writing or debugging *seccomp* policies for the **Oz** 
sandbox. The numbers are presented in decimal and hexadecimal format.
