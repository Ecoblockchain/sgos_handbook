# Features and advanced usage

This chapter describes the unique features of Subgraph OS. These are features
that distinguish it from other operating systems. This is where you can find 
more information about the design of Subgraph OS. 

As an *adversary resistant computing* platform, Subgraph OS is designed to 
resist threats to security and privacy. This chapter includes more information 
about how our design addresses these threats. We also provide links to external 
sources where more in-depth technical information is available.

This chapter also provides documentation for some advanced use-cases in Subgraph 
OS. This content is more technical than previous chapters in the Subgraph OS 
Handbook. It contains *how-tos* and reference materials intended for users who 
are comfortable running commands in the terminal and editing configuring files.
