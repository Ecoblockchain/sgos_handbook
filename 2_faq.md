## What is Subgraph OS?

Subgraph OS is an adversary resistant computing platform. The main purpose of
Subgraph OS is to empower people to communicate, share, and collaborate without
fear of surveillance and interference. What this means in practical terms is 
that users of Subgraph OS can safely perform their day-to-day tasks securely
and privately.

In some ways, Subgraph OS is like other operating systems -- it is derived 
from Debian GNU/Linux and uses the GNOME desktop environment as its graphical 
user interface. Many applications found in other Linux distributions are also 
available in Subgraph OS. Therefore, users who are already familiar to Linux and 
particularly the GNOME desktop environment will find Subgraph OS easy to use. 

Subgraph OS also has key differences from conventional Linux operating systems.
In particular:

1. Subgraph OS anonymizes Internet traffic by sending it through the Tor network
2. Subgraph OS is hardened against common security vulnerabilities 
3. Subgraph runs many desktop applications in a security sandbox to limit their
risk in case of compromise

## What do we mean by security and privacy?

Security and privacy can have many different meanings. In computer security, a 
secure system is one that assures the `confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability` of information it stores, processes, or communicates.

>`Confidentiality` assures that information is not revealed to anybody who is not authorized
>
>`Integrity` assures that information cannot be modified or tampered with by anybody who is not authorized
>
>`Availability` assures that information can be reliably accessed by those who are authorized

Privacy is similar to confidentiality. Privacy also relies heavily on the 
integrity of communications. But we think about in a broader sense as well. 

We believe it as a fundamental right for people to communicate with each other 
privately. We also believe that people should not be required to reveal 
information about themselves or their social network without explicit consent. 
This is an ongoing challenge because our devices and the applications we use 
reveal a great deal of information about us. Additionally, they communicate this 
private information over networks that are untrustworthy and hostile.

We designed Subgraph OS with these privacy concerns in mind.

## What is adversary resistant computing?
 
Subgraph OS has been designed from the ground up to defend against threats to
security and privacy. We aim to provide our users with a computing platform 
that is `adversary resistant`. 

We when use the term `adversary`, we are referring to an actual or hypothetical 
threat to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. 

A hacker exploiting a vulnerability in an application is one type of adversary.
This is an actual and often active threat to security and privacy.

Passive or indirect threats also exist. A passive or indirect threat may be 
an adversary conducting surveillance by intercepting and analyzing network 
traffic.

Lastly, adversaries may present a theoretical or impractical threat. For 
example, a cryptography algorithm may have a theoretical weakness. As 
technology and attack methods improve, the weakness is no longer theoretical and 
may be practically exploited. 

We use the term `adversary` to cover all of the above possibilities. 

Secure systems should be resistant to all of these types of threats.

While no computing platform can anticipate and defend against all possible
threats by all possible adversaries, we aspire to make such attacks extremely
difficult for adversaries. And in making these attacks difficult, they also
become more expensive for adversaries to scale.

Some of our users have critical security and privacy needs. Subgraph OS affords
them strong security and privacy to conduct their activities safely. Casual
users are afforded the same security and privacy without having to sacrifice
the usability and maintainability afforded by other operating systems. 

This is the `adversary resistant computing` paradigm.
