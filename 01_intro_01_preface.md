# Preface

We have created this handbook as an instructional manual on how to use the
Subgraph operating system. This handbook also introduces various security
and privacy enhancing technologies that we have developed at Subgraph.

We wrote this book for new users of Subgraph OS. Whether you are new to Linux 
or coming from another Linux-based operating system, we want to ease your 
transition to Subgraph OS.

In the first section, we describe how to perform common tasks such as
installing Subgraph OS and using the various applications that are included.
Start here to get up and running with Subgraph OS as quickly as possible. 

The next section describes the various features of Subgraph OS that 
distinguish it from other operating systems. Users can refer to this section to 
learn the various security and privacy features. Advanced users will find this 
section useful for configuring operating system features and Subgraph 
applications.
