# Preface

We have created this handbook as an instructional manual on how to use the
Subgraph operating system. This handbook also introduces various security
and privacy enhancing technologies that we have developed at Subgraph.

This handbook is intended for new users of Subgraph OS, including users
who are already familiar with other Linux-based operating systems. It also 
includes users who are just getting started with Linux. We hope that this 
handbook helps to ease the transition for both groups of users.

The first section of this book describes how to perform common tasks such as
installing Subgraph OS and using the various applications that are included.
Users who want to get up and running as quickly as possible should start here. 

In the next section, we describe the various features of Subgraph OS that 
distinguish it from other operating systems. This is intended for users who are 
interested in learning in\-depth about the various security and privacy 
enhancements that we have implemented. Advanced users will find this section 
useful for configuring operating system features and Subgraph applications.
